## What is Tableau?

Tableau became popular in the early 2000s. It is the leading data visualization and business intelligence tool for companies that want to be data-driven.

Tableau can integrate with and get data from a wide variety of sources like Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, and Google Analytics. It can even integrate with files like JSON, text, statistical and spatial files.

## What is Power BI?

Power BI is a suite of data analysis and visualization tools and services that helps you convert data into visually interactive reports. It was made available to the public in 2011.

Power BI integrates with various data sources such as Excel workbook, SQL server, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft Access. You can then turn this data into any kind of visualization that pleases you. You can also enter your data manually.

That chart could be a pie chart, bar chart, funnel, R and Python Visual, or even a Q & A. Power Bi is a powerful data visualization tool.

The cool features you have access to with Power BI include:

    smooth integration with Microsoft products
    data refreshes
    mobile app
    map creation
    a wide variety of charts
    custom charts with R and Python
    integration with Azure machine learning
    
    
## Why Use Power BI or Tableau Instead of Excel?

Tableau and Power BI are made for one important thing Excel is not primarily made for â€“ data visualization. I know you can still make charts with Excel, but that functionality is limited in comparison to both Power BI and Tableau.

In addition, Tableau and Power BI are more powerful than Excel when it comes to visuals and dashboards. They also have faster processing times than Excel.
